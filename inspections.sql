/*
Write SQL Statements to answer each of the following questions. You should use a single SQL statement
for each question. The overall purpose of these questions is to confirm that you understand the basic
syntax and functionality of SQL. In answering these questions, do not worry about the “quality” of the
data. Write the queries to retrieve data “as is”.
1. (5 points) Create a list of food service businesses and their owners. Include the business id,
business name, owner name, owner address, owner city, owner state, and owner ZIP columns.
Sort the results by state, city, and business name.
2. (5 points) How many records per business are included in the inspections table? Sort the result
set in descending order by record count.
3. (10 points) Are there any businesses in the violations table that are not in the businesses table?
4. (10 points) How many violations does each business have for each inspection? Your response
should only include businesses that exist in the businesses table.
5. (10 points) List the business id, business name, inspection date, inspection score, and inspection
type for all inspections that included violation type id = 103123 (food in poor condition).
6. (10 points) Create a list of latitude/longitude pairs for businesses that have latitude and
longitude values and the latitude and longitude values are not equal to ‘0’. The result table
should include business name, latitude, longitude, and the latitude/longitude pair. If the latitude
for a record = 37.8 and longitude = -122.5, the latitude/longitude pair should look like (37.8, -
122.5). Your result should include the (), comma, and space.

Advanced SQL Queries
Write SQL statements to answer each of the following questions. Use as many SQL statements as
necessary to respond to the question. Add comments to explain your actions, observations, and
conclusions.

7. (15 points) Explore the type column in the inspections table. The data dictionary indicates that
the inspection type “must be (initial, routine, followup).” Are there any inspections with an
inspection type that is not a valid value? List the business id, business name, inspection date,
